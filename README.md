$\LaTeX$ support for creating résumés in $Lua\TeX$ using [JSON Resume](https://github.com/jsonresume).  Still a work in progress, and only partially builds.  Uses the `meta` key allowed in JSON resume to make small customizations to the format of the generated PDF.  Also requires that the [`glyph` LaTeX package](https://github.com/cawaltrip/latex-glyph) be installed and [Font Awesome 6 Pro Fonts](https://fontawesome.com/) be installed as system fonts.
